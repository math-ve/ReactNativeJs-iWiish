# iWiish

this is an application I am currently working on. I am far from finished but I work on it daily.

## Why building such an app ?

The main goal is to improve myself in **react-native** and to be able to show my skills to anyone who is interested in my profile.

However, I hope this project can see the light of day on the AppStore & the Google Store soon.

## What is it about ?

The main idea of iWiish is to allow users to create wishlists but don't worry, it won't be a simple app like we can already find 15 of its kind.

Each user of the app will have their own account where they will be able to post their wishlists and then share them with anyone.

The application will offer a "mini social network" aspect, a bit like an instagram for wish lists. The user will be able to search for other users and see their lists.

The application is much more complex but I do not want to reveal everything here. If you want more information about it feel free to contact me : ***mathieu.vaneynde@gmail.com***

## How am I building it ?

The application will be built in ***react-native***. 

All the backend aspect is contained on ***Firebase***.
